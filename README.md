# Ultimate Rust Foundations

![](/images/ardanlabs-logo.png)

Presented by [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/), Ultima Rust: Foundations gives you a "zero to hero" class to get you started with Rust. You'll learn the basics of Rust, before diving into hands-on learning that can help you build a Rust foundation into your architecture. Take advantage of the speed and safety of Rust, tame the borrow and lifetime checkers, and pick up some tricks to help you become productive in Rust.

This is presented as 5x 1-day classes, which may be taken together or individually.

> Please have Rust installed (via RustUp) and a text editor or IDE setup when you take this class.
